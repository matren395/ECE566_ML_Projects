Projects #2 for ECE 566: Introduction to Machine Learning

Project #2 concerned working with a Convoluted Neural Network using the TensorFlow-Keras API to differentiate between handwritten digits from 0-9 while including considerable noise. Using the optimizer SGD and the Early Stopping option to prevent reduntantly long runtimes, the Convoluted Neural Network I constructed was able to reach a Testing Accuracy of above 90%, though further optimization is possible.
